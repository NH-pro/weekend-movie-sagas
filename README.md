## Description
*Duration*: 2 days<br>
This was an assignment to experiment and test out using Redux-Sagas. Using a movie theatre theme, we were tasked to display all movie posters from our database and when a user clicks on a movie poster, the user would be brought to that movie's page and display its description. This is the product of a couple days of learning about sagas.<br>
